## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist Steve, who was assisting his parents, by creating a stock analysis tool using VBA.  With this tool, Steve was to be able to analyze stocks his parents were interested in over the course of two years (2017 and 2018).  The analysis had to be easy and quick so the end goal was to refactor the existing code created over the course of the module.
### Results
This project produced a new sheet in the workbook for rendering stock analysis for 2017 and 2018.  When the code is run, it generates a table of twelve stocks and their performance over 2017 or 2018—whichever Steve wants to see thanks to a dialogue box that lets him type in the year.  The results include the stock’s ticker symbol in column A, the total daily volume in column B and the rate of return in column C.
Running the script had to be quick for Steve, and it was after the original code was refactored.  Attached are the run times after the original code was refactored:

Here is the refactored code:

### Summary
#### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring our code makes it look cleaner and run quicker than before.  It makes debugging easier.  It also gives others the chance to understand what we’re trying to accomplish.  The downside of refactoring is it can be expensive considering the time it takes to do.  It also allows more room for error if the code isn’t properly rewritten.
#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
What was nice about refactoring code was it taught me some better ways to achieve the same end goal.  I had to perform several Google searches to find the right expressions but as I applied them to the original code, and saw them work properly, it gave me a sense of accomplishment.  The one downside was it did take me a long time to rewrite elements of the original code but ultimately it was worth it.
